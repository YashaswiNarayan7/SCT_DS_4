# 🚦 Task 4 – Traffic Accident Analysis using Power BI

As part of my Data Science Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze traffic accident data in the US. The dashboard focuses on uncovering patterns based on weather conditions, time, and the presence of traffic signals.

## 📁 Dataset Used
- **US Traffic Accidents (Kaggle)**
- Format: `CSV`
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

---

## 📊 Key KPIs & Visuals

- 🚧 **Accidents by Weather Condition** – Identified weather-related risk factors  
- 📅 **Monthly Accident Trend** – Uncovered seasonal variations  
- 🚦 **Traffic Signal Presence** – Compared accidents where signals existed vs. not  
- 📊 **Interactive Filters** – Enabled drill-downs by weather, signal, and date

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- Excel for initial data formatting

---

## 🔍 Insights Derived

- **Clear weather** had the highest number of accidents, but rain and fog showed higher severity rates  
- Accident numbers peak in **winter months**, indicating seasonal influence  
- Roads **without traffic signals** had a noticeably higher accident rate
